## What is SpaceSniffer?

**SpaceSniffer** is a powerful, portable disk space analysis tool for Windows that helps you visualize storage allocation through interactive treemap charts. Unlike conventional file managers, SpaceSniffer provides a comprehensive, graphical representation of your disk usage, making it easy to identify large files, folders, and space-wasting clutter.

With SpaceSniffer, users can:
- Quickly scan entire drives or specific directories.
- View file distribution in an intuitive, nested rectangle layout.
- Filter results by name, size, or type.
- Reclaim valuable disk space by locating unnecessary files.

The tool is completely free, requires no installation, and is compatible with all modern versions of Windows. It's especially useful for system administrators, developers, and power users who need to manage storage efficiently.
